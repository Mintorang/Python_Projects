This is a repository of all the Python Projects I have completed. (May include beginner projects) 

if you want to have a further look at this code or remix it. Please follow these instructions. This code should all be in the terminal:
  1. Create a new directory for the code to be in and cd into that directory
       ```python
       mkdir Python_Projects
       cd Python_Projects
  2. Initialiase a Git repository in the directory

       git init

  3. Clone this repisitory into the git branch
